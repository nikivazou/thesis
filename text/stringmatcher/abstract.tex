In this paper, we prove correctness of parallelizing a string matcher
using Haskell as a theorem prover.
%
We use refinement types to specify correctness properties,
Haskell terms to express proofs and Liquid Haskell to
check correctness of proofs.
%
First, we specify and prove that a class of monoid morphisms
can be parallelized via parallel monoid concatenation.
%
Then, we encode string matching as a morphism
to get a provably correct parallel transformation.
%
Our 1839LoC prototype proof shows that
Liquid Haskell can be used as a fully expressive
theorem prover on realistic Haskell implementations.
