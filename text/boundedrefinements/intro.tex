Must program verifiers always choose between expressiveness
and automation?
%
On the one hand, tools based on higher order logics
and full dependent types impose no limits on expressiveness,
but require user-provided (perhaps, tactic-based) proofs.
%
On the other hand, tools based on Refinement Types~\cite{Rushby98,pfenningxi98}
trade expressiveness for automation. For example, the refinement types
%
\begin{code}
  type Pos     = {v:Int | 0 < v}
  type IntGE x = {v:Int | x <= v}
\end{code}
%
specify subsets of @Int@ corresponding to values
that are positive or larger than some other value @x@
respectively. By limiting the refinement predicates to
SMT-decidable logics~\cite{Nelson81}, refinement type
based verifiers eliminate the need for explicit proof terms,
and thus automate verification.

% We can specify contracts like pre- and post-conditions by
% suitably refining the input and output types of functions.

This high degree of automation has enabled the
use of refinement types for a variety of verification
tasks, ranging from array bounds checking~\cite{LiquidPLDI08},
termination and totality checking~\cite{Vazou14},
protocol validation~\cite{GordonTOPLAS2011,FournetCCS11},
and securing web applications~\cite{SwamyOAKLAND11}.
%
Unfortunately, this automation comes at a price.
To ensure predictable and decidable type checking, we must
limit the logical formulas appearing in specification types
to decidable (typically quantifier free) first order theories,
thereby precluding \emph{higher-order} specifications that
are essential for \emph{modular} verification.

In this chapter we introduce \emph{Bounded Refinement Types} which enable 
\emph{bounded quantification} over refinements. 
%
Previously (Chapter~\ref{chapter:abstractrefinements}),
we developed Abstract Refinement Types, a mechanism
for quantifying type signatures over abstract refinement parameters.
%
We preserved decidability of checking and inference
by encoding abstractly refined types with uninterpreted functions
obeying the decidable axioms of congruence~\cite{Nelson81}. 
%
While useful,
refinement quantification was not enough to enable higher order abstractions
requiring fine grained \emph{dependencies between} abstract refinements.
%
In this chapter, we solve this problem by enriching signatures
with bounded quantification. 
%
The \emph{bounds} correspond to Horn
implications between abstract refinements, which, as in the classical
setting, correspond to subtyping constraints that must be satisfied 
by the concrete refinements used at any call-site. This
addition proves to be remarkably effective.

\begin{itemize}
\item
First, we demonstrate via a series of short examples how bounded refinements
enable the specification and verification of diverse textbook higher order
abstractions that were hitherto beyond the scope of decidable refinement
typing~(\S~\ref{sec:boundedrefinementtypes:overview}).

\item
Second, we formalize bounded types and show how bounds are translated
into ``ghost'' functions, reducing type checking and inference to the
``unbounded'' setting of chapter~\ref{chapter:abstractrefinements}, 
thereby ensuring that checking
remains decidable. Furthermore, as the bounds are Horn constraints, we
can directly reuse the abstract interpretation of Liquid Typing~\citep{LiquidPLDI08}
to automatically infer concrete refinements at instantiation
sites~(\S~\ref{sec:check}).

\item
Third, to demonstrate the expressiveness of bounded refinements, we
use them to build a typed library for extensible dictionaries, to
then implement a relational algebra library on top of those
dictionaries, and to finally build a library for type-safe
database access~(\S~\ref{sec:database}).

\item
Finally, we use bounded refinements to develop a \emph{Refined State Transformer}
monad for stateful functional programming, based upon Filli\^atre's method
for indexing the monad with pre- and post-conditions~\citep{Filliatre98}.
%
We use bounds to develop branching and looping combinators whose types
signatures capture the derivation rules of Floyd-Hoare logic, thereby
obtaining a library for writing verified stateful computations~(\S~\ref{sec:state}).
%
We use this library to develop a refined IO monad that tracks capabilities
at a fine-granularity, ensuring that functions only access specified
resources~(\S~\ref{sec:files}).
\end{itemize}

We have implemented Bounded Refinement Types in \toolname.
The source code of the examples (with slightly more verbose concrete syntax)
is at \cite{liquidhaskellgithub}.
%
While the construction of these verified abstractions is possible with full
dependent types, bounded refinements
%
keep checking automatic and decidable,
%
use abstract interpretation to automatically synthesize
refinements (\ie pre- and post-conditions and loop invariants),
and most importantly
%
enable retroactive or \emph{gradual} verification as when
erase the refinements, we get valid programs in the
host language.
%
Thus, bounded refinements point a way towards 
both automated and expressive verification.
