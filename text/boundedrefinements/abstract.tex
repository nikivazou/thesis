We present a notion of bounded quantification for refinement types
and show how it expands the expressiveness of refinement typing
by using it to develop typed combinators for:
%
(1)~relational algebra and safe database access,
%
(2)~Floyd-Hoare logic within a state transformer
    monad equipped with combinators for branching
    and looping, and
%
(3)~using the above to implement a refined IO
    monad that tracks capabilities and resource usage.
%
This leap in expressiveness comes via a translation to ``ghost" functions,
which lets us retain the automated and decidable SMT based checking and
inference that makes refinement typing effective in practice.
